## My process

First, I structure the HTML. Then, I styles the webpage in Mobile-first workflow. After that, I work on the responsiveness of the webpage.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned on how to style the webpage in Mobile-first workflow.

### Continued development

I will try to focus on how I can style the webpage a lot more faster. I notice that it takes a lot of time while I'm working with this project.
